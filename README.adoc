= xtdb-http-multinode

This XTDB module is based on the http-server module and adds supports for
multiple nodes.

Creating nodes can done using a POST to `/_xtdb/create-node` with the name of
the name given as the `node` parameter:

[source,curl]
----
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/edn" \
     -H "Accept: application/edn" \
     -d '{:node "test"}' $XTDB_URL/_xtdb/create-node
----

Deleting is done with a POST to `/_xtdb/create-node` with the name of the name
also given as the `node` parameter. This will delete all data of this node on
disk:

[source,curl]
----
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/edn" \
     -H "Accept: application/edn" \
     -d '{:node "test"}' $XTDB_URL/_xtdb/delete-node
----

The rest of the API is the same but the node name needs to be added as path
after `_xtdb`:

[source,curl]
----
curl -X GET \
     -H "Accept: application/edn" \
     $XTDB_URL/_xtdb/test/status
----
